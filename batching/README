Batching specific templates are here.

batch-stage.xltx is a template for a batch recipe's stages.  You will require one modified version of this template, saved as a CSV file, for each recipe.

batch-materials.xltx is a template for a material used in a batch.  The name of the material must match up with the fill_material field in the recipe stages.  The fields with a light blue/grey background are not yet maintained by the Lua libraries and are here for future expansion only.  You should edit this file and save it in CSV format as materials.csv in your project.

batch-recipes.xltx is a template for the batch recipes.  The recipe field gives the name of the batch recipe and the datafile field gives the name of the corresponding batch stage CSV file (include the full file name with .csv).  You should edit this file and save it in CSV format as recipes.csv in your project.
