# Lua Development tools

Lua is a plain text scripting language and so can be created with any text editor.  The M4223 ships with an onboard text editor for the purpose called vi.  Lua script can therefore be developed on the M4223 directly using a remote telnet service like PuTTY.

## Windows Development
Usually, however, it is more convenient to edit the lua script files using a more advanced editor on a remote computer and copy the files to the M4223 using the built in FTP services.  Windows editors like Notepad++ recognise Lua syntax and highlight the script accordingly to make editing more convenient.  Notepad++ is a free product and can be configured to work with the files remotely using a FTP plugin.  Alternatively there are many FTP programs like winSCP that can be used to synchronise the files from your development computer to the M4223.

## Existing Developers
For existing developers it is very likely that your existing programmers editor will support Lua so you can develop scripts for the M4223 in a familiar environment.  Eclipse for example is a popular programming environment that fully supports the Lua scripting language and is available on many platforms including Mac, PC and Linux.
