The M4223 Lua module is a very capable device.  It features the Lantronix&reg; PremierWave&reg; EN Embedded Linux System on Module.  This small form factor system contains a powerful 32-bit ARM9 processor running at 400MHz.  The module runs the Linux operating system.

## Memory

The M4223 has a total of 64 Mbytes of onboard flash memory and supports an onboard file system that typically ships with around 40 Mbytes of free space to store custom scripts and data.  In addition it contains 64 Mbytes of SDRAM for running the operating system and program in.

## USB

The full speed USB 2.0 host port is supported with USB drivers for all generic devices including keyboards, barcode readers, ticket printers, serial ports, bluetooth, and flash memory sticks.  It is therefore possible to extend the memory capacity of the M4223 using external storage.

The USB port fully supports the use of USB hubs including externally powered hubs so the range of connectivity options is not restricted
