The C500 is a very capable device. It features a Freescale Coldfire processor running at 240MHz. The module runs the Linux operating system.

## Memory

The C500 has a total of 8 Mbytes of onboard flash memory and supports an onboard file system that typically ships with around 4 Mbytes of free space to store custom scripts and data. In addition it contains 32 Mbytes of SDRAM for running the operating system and program in.

## USB

The full speed USB 1.1 host port is supported with USB drivers for all generic devices including keyboards, barcode readers, ticket printers, serial ports, and flash memory sticks. It is therefore possible to extend the memory capacity of the C500 using external storage.
