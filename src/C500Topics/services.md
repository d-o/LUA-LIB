# Services

The device hosts a webserver onboard and exposes a number of linux services including:

    * FTP
    * SFTP
    * SSH
    * Telnet

You can access any of these services via the usual programs you run on your computer.  By default SSH and SFTP are not enabled.

The webserver is used to manage and maintain the installed software packages and to reboot the device.
